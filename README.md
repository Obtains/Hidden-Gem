## Description

AS A person who loves to explore and avoid crowds, 

I WANT a site that allows me to discover places to explore that are fascinating and not well-known

SO THAT I can plan a great vacation.

Hidden Gems is a site where users can create an account and post different great places to tour or visit on vacation. Users will add a name of the site, location, city, state, country, visitorship, pictures, and a description. The homepage will show the top liked spots in the form of cards that include the title and picture. Users can also like and comment on whatever gem they choose. All locations must have less than 100,000 visitors per year. When the user clicks on the card, it will take the user to that location's page where all the info and comments are. There will also be a dashboard where logged-in users can change profile information, add gems, delete gems, and edit gems.

Once complete, the program should operate so that:

WHEN I check the dependencies,

THEN I see that Node.js and Express.js were used to create a RESTful API.

WHEN I check the views folder,

THEN I find that Handlebars.js was used as the templating engine.

WHEN I check the models and controllers folder,

THEN I can confirm that MySQL and the Sequelize ORM were used for the database.

WHEN I look at the routes, 

THEN I find both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

WHEN I want to open the application,

THEN I can do it by visiting the Heroku site and find that there is already data in it.

WHEN I look at the dependencies, 

THEN I find at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed being used.

WHEN I interact with the application,

THEN I get the feeling that the application is responsive, interactive, and has a polished UI.

WHEN I check the folder structure,

THEN I see that it meets the MVC paradigm.

WHEN I log onto the site,

THEN I go through some kind of authentication (express-session and cookies).

WHEN I try to get any API keys or sensitive information,

THEN I find they've been protected with environment variables.

WHEN I check the repository,

THEN I see it's clean and meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

WHEN I look at the README,

THEN I see it is of high quality, including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Credits

The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).The WHEN/THEN section of this README was based off the project assignment Acceptance Criteria. Most influence was taken from Just-Tech-News of Modules 13 and 14. Stack Overflow, MDN Web Docs, W3, and Google were critical to our success. Bootstrap, JQuery, MySql, Node.js, Insomnia, NPM, Express.js, express-session, Handlebars, Sequelize, bcrypt, and dotenv were used. Pixabay was used for stock photos. Bootstrap-select-country, created by mojoaxel, was implemented in the Add-Gem form.

<!-- OTHER TO-DOs:
double check media queries once everything's hooked up
Double check all handlebars data is correctly hooked up
EDIT GEM:
Add the Delete Gem ability with a modal that pops up and asks "Are you sure you want to delete this gem?" State (make a dropdown of options of states and US Territories, but only if the Country value is the USA. Otherwise, make it a typed-in input)
ADD GEM: 
Activity Type (Again, create a dropdown of the main activity types we plan to have. When you have more time, also provide an Other option, where an additional input box appears for the user to type in a new activity if we don't have it already).
Provide an option for the city name, as well as longitude and Latitude coordinates. Star the ones above, since they're required. Change the font type if not all the required answers are indeed answered and redirect the page to the part of the page that says
"Please make sure to fill out all required * fields"npm seeds
